XFaster Documentation
=====================
XFaster is a power spectrum and parameter likelihood estimator for cosmic microwave background (CMB) data sets.
It's a hybrid of two types of estimators: pseudo-Cl Monte Carlo estimators, like MASTER/PolSpice, and iterative quadratic estimators.
The full description of the pipeline, including the math and assumptions used, is in a soon-to-be-released paper.
These docs focus on using the code.

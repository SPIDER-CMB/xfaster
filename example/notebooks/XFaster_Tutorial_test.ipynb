    "First, we'll introduce the Newton method for iteratively finding the root of a function. There are helpful pictures to visualize how this method works [on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method). Say you have some continuous function, $f$, and your initial guess for its root is $x_0$. We can Taylor expand $f$ around this guess like so:\n",

    "\n",
    "Ultimately, XFaster isn't going to solve for a root; it's going to find the extreme of some function. So instead of finding where $f=0$, we want to find where its first derivative goes to 0. So now we're going to take the first derivative of equation 1 and set it equal to 0:\n",

    "Before we get into the functions that produce each of the components that gets fed into equations \\ref{eq:qb} and \\ref{eq:fisher}, let's first talk about how XFaster is structured and what it expects as inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main python modules in XFaster: `xfaster_exec.py` and `xfaster_class.py`. `xfaster_exec` was written to mirror `unimap_exec`. It contains two main functions: `xfaster_run` and `xfaster_submit`. `xfaster_run` calls all of the functions to make XFaster happen (all located in `xfaster_class`) in the order they need to happen. `xfaster_submit` takes arguments for submitting the job to a queue. XFaster is not highly parallelized like `unimap`. The only real benefit it can get from using multiple cores is through the OMP speed up from numpy matrix operations. Therefore, unless you're drowning in more cores than you know what to do with, I would recommend only using one core for XFaster jobs, and splitting things up as best you can in other ways (ie, if running sims, have a handful of sims per job instead of running them all in series). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few other modules you might interact with: \n",
    "* `xfaster_tools.py`: contains small functions used in xfaster_class\n",
    "* `parse_tools.py`: contains a bunch of tools for converting between data structures, especially between dictionaries and matrices\n",
    "* `output_class.py`: contains tools for parsing data on disk for post-processing. This will only be very useful if you're looking at XFaster outputs created prior to July 22, 2019, when things were stored as arrays instead of dictionaries. We would now recommend loading the outputs directly with `xfaster.load_and_parse('<output>.npz')` and grabbing things in the dictionaries there. This is illustrated in the last section of this document."

So, for example, to run XFaster on this set of maps, I need to specify in my arguments: `clean_type=raw` (this is a confusing name for a variable, but just remember this designates the data type), `signal_type=flatBBDl`, `noise_type=stationary`, `mask_type=pointsource_latlon_aphalfdeg`.\n",

We have always used the same mask for I and P, but it's not required. You must have a mask file for each map tag, so if I'm doing a run with maps for 90 and 150 GHz maps, I need a mask for each of those, even if it's the same mask. You can use symlinks to save on disk space in that case.\n",

In the labah data set, I have 1000 signal and noise sims for SPIDER, but only 200 of each for Planck. So I need to tell XFaster to only use the first 200 signal and noise sims it finds. I can do that using the `signal_subset` and `noise_subset` arguments, which default to `'*'`. Now, I need to specify (in a glob-parseable manner) which tags that come after `map_90_`, eg, to use. Each sim is indexed with four digits, so `map_90_0000.fits, map_90_0001.fits`, etc. If I want the first 200 of each sim, I'm first going to test my expression (I'm piping it into a line count to reduce the output, but you don't have to):"

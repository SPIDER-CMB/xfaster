XFaster implementation by A. Gambrel, A. Rahlin, C. Contaldi.

XFaster is a fast power spectrum and likelihood estimator for CMB datasets.
It has most recently been used for the SPIDER B-mode polarization results, but is intended to be generically useful for modern CMB observatories.
An accompanying paper describing the algorithm is expected in February 2021.

scripts:
    scripts for testing and running the code

data:
    auxiliary data used by xfaster

xfaster:
    python package

documentation:
    documentation on usage, file structure, etc.

To get started, add the following two lines to your .bash_profile:

    export XFASTER_PATH=/path/to/xfaster
    source $XFASTER_PATH/scripts/xfaster_env.sh

NB: the directory $XFASTER_PATH/xfaster contains the python library code, so
    the python path needs to point to $XFASTER_PATH, *not* $XFASTER_PATH/xfaster,
    in order to be able to run `import xfaster` successfully.
